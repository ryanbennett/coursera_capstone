    "I live in Milwaukee and for business I have traveled to the west coast quite a bit, specifically to Portland. I remember running across this article: https://www.salon.com/2014/08/20/milwaukee_is_the_new_portland_partner and wondering - is this really true? They do feel similar, but what does the data say? Do they have similarities in the make-up of their neighborhoods? This project will explore similarities and differences of the distinct make-up of both cities at the neighborhood level."
